A WebApp (tried making it a IOS App, but I'd rather go back to the old web stack) that lets you
manage your money in a breeze with a focus on your privacy. It features automatic transaction import
via E-Mail!



There are a lot of money managers out there, but none of them support automatic transaction import in Switzerland. The reason for this is probably that none of the Banks really support access to transactions from a third party. My solution to this problem sounds a bit sketchy but it works perfectly fine.  
For the most modern bank accounts you can enable an E-Mail notification for each transaction that occured. I plan on reading these E-Mails and importing them into my money manager. This means that you have to grant my app access to your IMAP Server.
